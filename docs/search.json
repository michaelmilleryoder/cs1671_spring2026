    "text": "Project idea form\nDue 02-05.\n\nIn this form, you can submit project ideas you might be interested in working on. You can fill out ideas from the example projects listed below or one of your own ideas. For your own ideas, consider what computer system you’d like to build that processes language in some form, interesting text datasets you’d like to work on, really anything! It is best if your idea has a dataset in mind, but this is not required.\nYou can fill out as many ideas as you’d like with this form. Ideas do not have to be fully sketched out. Submitting an idea does mean you will necessarily work on it. These ideas will be presented to all students anonymously. Each student must submit at least one idea for credit on this assignment, even if it’s just chosen from the example projects.\n\nExample projects\nSome of these projects are drawn from “shared tasks” where NLP researchers compete for the best performance on certain datasets. The instructor will provide data for these projects, though it may still require further preprocessing for use.\n\n1. Text classification\n\nClassify adversarial prompts for LLMs based on attack type, using publicly available red-teaming datasets.\nGiven a review of a restaurant, determine what type of restaurant it is from this Yelp dataset\nGiven a short essay in response to a troubling news article, predict the level of empathy. See WASSA 2024 shared task Track 3.\nPredict emotion labels from tweets across many languages. See WASSA 2024 shared task\nGiven a news article and a list of “entities” (people, organizations, etc), predict roles such as protagonist, antagonist, and innocent. See SemEval 2025 Task 10, Subtask 1 on entity framing\nPredict news genre or media “frames” such as morality, economic, or crime and punishment from news articles in multiple languages. See SemEval 2023 Task 3, Subtasks 1 or 2\nPredict whether text was written by humans or generated by AI. Tasks include predicting for data across languages and for academic essays. See GenAI Content Detection Workshop, Task 1 or 2\nClassify tweets as sexist or not, or predict the “intent” of sexist tweets as direct, reported or judgemental. See EXIST 2024 Task 1 or Task 2\nPredict if similar words are redundant or not with the Semantic Pleonasm corpus developed right here at Pitt.\n\n\n\n2. Machine translation\n\nTrain translation models for literary text and evaluate on a dataset of Korean-English webnovels developed by a former student in this class.\nTranslate customer service chats in between languages. See the WMT 2024 Chat Shared Task\nTranslate code-mixed Hinglish to English. See the WMT 2022 Code-mixed Machine Translation Task\nCreate a system to automatically correct (post-edit) machine translations. See the WMT 2022 Automatic Post-Editing Shared Task\n\n\n\n3. Information retrieval and extraction\n\nGiven a query, retrieve the most relevant passages from regulatory documents: https://www.codabench.org/competitions/3527/\nExtract important entities from scientific articles with the SCIRex dataset\n\n\n\n4. Summarization\n\nAutomatically summarize movies based on their subtitles from this dataset developed by former students in the class.\n\n\n\n5. Analysis and annotation of datasets\n\nImprove part-of-speech tagging and other linguistic annotation for spontaneous speech in the Archive of Pittsburgh Language and Speech (APLS) with collaborator Prof. Dan Villarreal in the Linguistics Department. An evaluation dataset for parts of speech has already been manually annotated and so this project is ready to go to evaluate different systems! This work would help linguistics researchers study specific linguistic phenomena by speakers here in Pittsburgh.\nVisualize similarities in US state legislature bill texts and predict bill passage using data from LegiScan (example repo here).\nDevelop an annotation guide and start annotating a new dataset of online gaming voice chat for hate speech, abusive, and offensive language.\nHate speech is culturally specific, yet the majority of NLP work focuses on English in North American and European contexts. A quantitative analysis of different features of datasets annotated for hate speech in multiple languages and from multiple cultural contexts would illuminate global similarities and culturally specific contexts. \nQuantitative analysis of hateful, white supremacist narratives usually centers on contemporary online discourse. Yet many white supremacist language and narratives has its roots before online discourse. Compare narratives, topics and themes presented in historic and contemporary white supremacist discourse with data provided by the instructor.\nExplore similarities and differences between language in podcasts and Reddit communities based on those podcasts using a dataset assembled by former Pitt students.\nComputational analysis of Palestinian Nakba narratives. See workshop and datasets.\nExamine the framing of different entities in police Facebook posts from the Plain View Project.\nAnalyze how different newspapers cover topics differently in English-language editorials from Sri Lankan newspapers. Data is provided by the instructor and a collaborator at Carnegie Mellon University."

For example, each input could be a sentence of text and the output could be a label from a discrete set of possible labels. Provide at least one example of input and output from your data (ideally actual input and output, but it’s fine if they are made up).\nData: What data are you using?\n\nHow many rows (datapoints) are in the dataset and what does each datapoint correspond to?\nHow many columns are in the dataset and what does each correspond to?\n\nProvide a very small subset of the data in a table.\nPlease explain where the dataset came from and how it was constructed, if known.\nProvide links to any URLs if the data is hosted online or links to papers if the dataset is published somewhere.\nIf the data has annotated labels or “gold” text that you are predicting or generating, where do those labels come from?\n\nMethods: What approach are you taking to building a NLP system to handle this task? What models and if appropriate, what methods of extracting features from text will be used? What software packages are you planning to use to build this system? Except in some cases, the approach should draw on statistical approaches we’ve covered in class so far, such as n-gram representations of text. Talk to the instructor if you are not sure about this.\nEvaluation: How are you evaluating your approach? What performance metrics are you going to use?\nEthics: What kinds of ethical issues may be raised by your model or data?\nSteps: What are the proposed steps needed for completion of (your proposed part) of the project? This should be in some detail, for example, loading and potentially cleaning the data, training models, trying different parameters, evaluating models, etc.\nRoles: What are roles and tasks of each person in the group? Though group members will contribute in various capacities, it is best if each person is responsible for at least one aspect of the project."

Please provide a specification of your problem/task and input and output. You do not have to repeat information from the project proposal except for that basic description of the project. Here are the details:\n\nPart 1: Basic data analysis\nIn this part, please provide the following information about your dataset. It’s fine to be working with multiple datasets; just complete this for each one or for a final dataset you will be using if you are combining datasets.\n\nIf it has been updated from the proposal, provide the number of rows (datapoints) and columns in the dataset and what each datapoint and column corresponds to. If you are splitting the dataset into a training, test, and possible dev sets, how many rows are in each?\nIf applicable, the distribution of the target labels you are predicting. So for a binary sentiment classification task, how many rows in each set (except the test set) are marked negative or positive sentiment? This can be in a table or graph format.\nOptionally, any other distribution or data visualization that you think is helpful for understanding your dataset or task.\n\n\n\nPart 2: A result from baseline (traditional) approach\nIn your proposal, you described an initial baseline approach to your task, which for most groups was using n-gram features in some way. Please provide one (hopefully quantitative) result from your work so far in this direction. Ideally this would be a performance metric result from your baseline approach on a dev or test set. But if you’re not that far yet, you can also provide an example of working input and output from your system or part of a system, some sort of plot or other output. You can be up front about challenges you are facing for which you might need help; to get a good grade, I’ll just be looking for some sort of output from a working system or part of a system. If you are confused what this means for your project, contact the instructor.\n\n\nPart 3: LLM proposal\nIn the project, you will be comparing your baseline system’s performance to that of an LLM. Please describe how you might use an LLM programmatically to attempt your task. The simplest way to do this would be in a “zero-shot” setting where you simply ask the LLM to do the task, but even that requires setting up and passing your data to the LLM and evaluating it. Please describe what you plan to do and which LLM you plan on using. You can also propose using more advanced approaches such as in-context learning (few-shot prompting), chain-of-thought prompting, prompt optimization or fine-tuning. Not all groups have to use an LLM here if you have already talked to the instructor; in that case, please describe the rest of the approach you will be taking to complete the project.\n\n\nPart 4: Open questions and challenges\nPlease describe any open questions or challenges your group has at this point. Will you need any resources other than the ones provided in class (OpenAI API access, CRCD access) or have any other questions? Also describe if the roles for each of your team members have changed since the proposal and if so, what the new roles are.\n\n\nDeliverable\nAssemble your results and writing for each part in a document to submit as a PDF on Canvas. There is no required format for this document other than being in PDF format."

Any student suspected of violating this obligation for any reason during the semester will be required to participate in the procedural process, initiated at the instructor level, as outlined in the University Guidelines on Academic Integrity. To learn more about Academic Integrity, visit the Academic Integrity Guide for an overview of the topic. For hands-on practice, complete the Academic Integrity Modules.\nFor any assignment where the academic integrity policy has been violated, students will be assigned a 0 (or a failing grade, depending on the extent).\n\nGenerative AI policy\nYou are allowed to use generative AI programs (ChatGPT, etc.) as a student in this course in limited circumstances. Since much of this course is about developing such tools in NLP, using currently available tools can expose you to the current capabilities and limitations of such systems.\nHowever, your ethical responsibilities as a student remain the same. You must follow the University of Pittsburgh’s Policy on Academic Integrity. Here are some principles to keep in mind that can help you determine whether or not a specific use of generative AI is acceptable in this course (for all forms of generation: writing, code, images or other forms). Please ask the instructor if you are not sure about a specific use. You will not be blamed or retaliated against for asking.\n\nUse as an aid, not for a finished product. LLMs could be used in this course to generate ideas, draft bibliographies, study guides, or for revising existing writing. Use for drafting entire homework or project reports is not acceptable, even if students revise this draft, since being able to communicate NLP procedures and research is a learning objective. Also keep in mind that language models have no notion of reality and will hallucinate facts and citations.\nAllowed code generation varies between homework assignments and the final project. The learning objectives of homework assignments in this class are to be able to implement NLP systems to address specific tasks. As such, code generation is allowed for small pieces of code in homework assignments, but not for the code used for answering an entire question. Students must understand what each line of code in their submitted homework assignments is doing. The open-ended course project, in contrast, focuses more on skills of designing NLP systems for new tasks and datasets. Larger blocks of generated code are allowed in the course project.\nCite its use. The University of Pittsburgh’s academic integrity policy applies to all uncited or improperly cited use of content, whether that work is created by human beings alone or in collaboration with a generative AI. If you use a generative AI tool to develop content for an assignment, you are required to cite the tool’s contribution to your work. In practice, cutting and pasting content from any source without citation is plagiarism. Likewise, paraphrasing content from a generative AI without citation is plagiarism. Similarly, using any generative AI tool without appropriate acknowledgement will be treated as plagiarism. See the APA guidelines on how to cite ChatGPT. Citing your use of LLMs will also inform teaching staff on how such tools are being used in education for developing better future policies.\nYou are responsible for the work you turn in. As we will discuss in this course, LLMs and other generative AI systems can and do generate biased, socially problematic language and assert unfounded claims. Ultimately the text you submit will be treated as reflecting your own work, and you are responsible for it.\n\nAdapted from faculty in the Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, with guidance from the Carnegie Mellon University Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence."
